## Changes in `1.1.0`

Check out the [1.1.0 milestone](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/milestone/42) to see new features / bugfixes in detail.

Singularity `1.1.0` is mainly focused on scheduler performance. Internally we have also begun testing this version on java 11. Some java 11 notes:
- While the default GC algorithm for java 11 has been updated to G1, we have seen better scheduler throughput and overall performance for SingularityService using parallelgc. We have not yet extensively tested zgc for Singularity
- The SingularityExecutor _must_ be upgraded to 1.1.0 to work with java 11. Earlier versions of all other components should still function on java11, but may not be as performant without the upadtes in this release
- If using mysql with Singularity, the ssl-related updates in the [updated version of mysql-connector-java](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/pull/2025) will provide much better performance and remove an error that would previously get logged whenever a new connection was created
